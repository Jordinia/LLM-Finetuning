This can provide hints about the website\\'s purpose.\\n*   **Content:**  The textual content scraped from the website. This content offers detailed information about the website\\'s topics, services, and themes.\\n\\n### **Labeling Instructions:**\\n\\nAnalyze both the **Domain** and the **Content** provided. Use keywords and contextual clues from both to determine the most appropriate category for the website.  Consider the primary purpose and content focus of the website when classifying.\\n\\n### **Confidence Assessment Guidelines: Point-Based System (Total Possible Points: 100)**\\n\\nTo determine the **confidence** level (0-100) for your classification, evaluate the following factors and sum up the points.  The total points will directly correspond to the confidence percentage (e.g., 95 points = 95% confidence).\\n\\n#### **I. Keyword Strength and Relevance (Maximum 40 Points)**\\n*   **(40 Points):  Exceptional Keyword Strength: Explicit and Overwhelming Keywords in BOTH Domain and Content:** Presence of extremely explicit and overwhelmingly strong keywords that are *unquestionably* indicative of a specific category in *both* the domain name AND the website content. These keywords leave absolutely no doubt about the website\\'s nature. (e.g., Domain: `casino-royal-betting.com`, Content:  \"Gamble now and win HUGE jackpots on slots, poker, roulette! Real money betting!\").  This represents the absolute strongest keyword signal possible.\\n*   **(35 Points): Clear and Strong Keywords in BOTH Domain and Content:**  Presence of highly explicit keywords strongly indicative of a specific category in both the domain name AND the website content. (e.g., Domain: `bet.com`, Content:  \"Bet on sports and casino games!\").\\n*   **(25 Points): Strong Keywords in EITHER Domain OR Content:** Presence of highly explicit keywords strongly indicative of a specific category in EITHER the domain name OR the website content, but not both.\\n*   **(15 Points): Some Relevant Keywords:** Presence of keywords related to a category, but they are less explicit, less frequent, or require more contextual interpretation in either domain or content.\\n*   **(0 Points): Weak or Generic Keywords:** Lack of clear category-specific keywords in both domain and content. Keywords are generic and do not strongly suggest any specific category.\\n\\n#### **II. Domain and Content Alignment (Maximum 30 Points)**\\n\\n*   **(30 Points): Strong Domain and Content Alignment:** Domain name strongly and unambiguously suggests a category, and the website content consistently and explicitly reinforces that category.  They tell the same clear story.\\n*   **(15 Points): Partial Domain and Content Alignment:** Domain name and content generally point towards the same category, but the alignment might be less direct, slightly ambiguous, or require some interpretation to connect them.\\n*   **(0 Points): Domain-Content Mismatch or No Alignment:** Domain name suggests one thing, but the content is unclear, suggests something different, or there\\'s no clear connection between the domain and the content\\'s apparent purpose.\\n\\n#### **III. Content Clarity and Unambiguity (Maximum 20 Points)**\\n\\n*   **(20 Points): Unambiguous and Explicit Content:** The website content is very clear, direct, and leaves virtually no room for interpretation. It unambiguously falls into one of the defined categories.\\n*   **(10 Points): Content Requires Some Interpretation:** The content generally points to a category, but requires some interpretation to confidently assign it.  There might be subtle hints, implied meanings, or a need to infer the primary purpose.\\n*   **(0 Points): Ambiguous or Conflicting Content:** The website content is vague, contradictory, or could be reasonably interpreted in multiple ways, making it difficult to confidently assign a category.\\n\\n#### **IV. Category Indicator Strength (Maximum 10 Points)**\\n\\n*   **(10 Points): Multiple Strong Category Indicators:** Presence of numerous strong and clear indicators for a specific category throughout the domain and content (e.g., for Pornography: explicit keywords, descriptions of sexual acts, calls to action to view adult content, age verification prompts).\\n*   **(5 Points): Some Category Indicators Present:** Presence of a few indicators for a category, but they are not overwhelmingly strong or numerous.\\n*   **(0 Points): Lack of Category Indicators:** Few or no clear indicators for any of the defined categories are present in the domain and content.\\n\\n#### **Calculation:**\\n\\n1.  For each of the four sections (I-IV), assess the website and select the point value that best describes the presence of the described factors.\\n2.  Sum up the points from all four sections.\\n3.  The total sum represents the confidence level in percentage (%).\\n\\n#### **Confidence Level Ranges (for reference - already implicitly defined by points):**\\n\\n*   **High Confidence (80-100 Points):**  Strong evidence across multiple factors pointing clearly to a category.\\n*   **Medium Confidence (50-79 Points):** Moderate evidence, some ambiguity or less directness in indicators.\\n*   **Low Confidence (0-49 Points):** Weak or conflicting evidence, high uncertainty about the correct category.\\n\\n#### **Example:**\\n\\nLet\\'s say you are classifying `lucky-slots-online.com` with content about slot games and bonuses.\\n\\n*   **I. Keyword Strength:** Strong keywords in both Domain and Content (e.g., \"slots,\" \"online,\" \"win,\" \"bonuses\") - **25 Points**\\n*   **II. Domain-Content Alignment:** Domain and content strongly align with Gambling - **30 Points**\\n*   **III. Content Clarity:** Content is very clear about gambling activities - **20 Points**\\n*   **IV. Category Indicators:** Multiple indicators of gambling (games, bonuses, calls to action) - **10 Points**\\n\\n**Total Points: 25 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 85 Points.  Confidence: 85%**\\n\\n#### **Using this Point System:**\\n\\nWhen generating the \"reason\" for your classification, you can now also briefly mention the points you assigned for each section to justify the final confidence score. For example:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"answer\": 1,\\n  \"classification\": \"Gambling\",\\n  \"reason\": \"Strong keywords in domain and content (25 pts), strong domain-content alignment (30 pts), clear gambling content (20 pts), multiple category indicators (10 pts).

       " {'content': '<think>\\nOkay, so I need to classify this website into one of the four categories: Benign, Gambling, Pornography, or Harmful. Let\\'s start by looking at the domain and content provided.  The domain is \"threegunnuts.com\". The name suggests it\\'s related to firearms since \"gun nuts\" typically refers to enthusiasts. Now, looking at the content, they describe themselves as a local gun shop in Spokane Valley, Washington. They carry new and used firearms, ammunition, and accessories. There are sections like Products, NFA Info (which relates to National Firearms Act items), Services, About Us, etc.  The content lists various manufacturers of firearms, such as Glock, Remington, Smith and Wesson, SIG SAUER, and others. They also list specific products like M1 Carbines, 1911 pistols, suppressors, and other related accessories. The prices are listed for these items, indicating they\\'re selling them.  Now, considering the categories:  - Benign: General info, news, services without explicit content. - Gambling: Promotes betting or casino activities. - Pornography: Explicit sexual content. - Harmful: Engages in illegal or harmful activities.  This site is clearly about firearms. The sale of firearms isn\\'t inherently harmful if it\\'s legal and properly regulated. However, under Indonesian law (UU ITE), selling weapons might fall into the \"Harmful\" category, especially if they\\'re promoting illegal sales or not following proper regulations.  Looking deeper, the content doesn\\'t mention anything about illegal activities. They seem to be a legitimate gun shop listing their products. But since they are dealing with firearms, which can be considered harmful if misused, but in this case, it\\'s more about legal transactions.  Wait, according to the guidelines, \"Harmful\" includes websites that promote or engage in illegal activities like selling weapons without proper licensing. Since the site is a gun shop, perhaps licensed, but without explicit information on their legality, we might still consider them under Harmful because they\\'re dealing with firearms which can be harmful.  But wait, in the examples provided, sites promoting drugs fall into Harmful. Selling guns could also be considered as such if it\\'s illegal. However, the site seems to be a legitimate business, so maybe it\\'s Benign? But no, because selling firearms is a controlled activity and might not fit under Benign.  Wait, looking back at the categories:  Benign includes general services without explicit content. Selling guns could be seen as a service but falls into a regulated category. However, since the site is about selling weapons, which can be harmful if misused, it\\'s better to classify it as Harmful because it\\'s promoting or facilitating access to weapons that can cause harm.  So, putting it all together:  - Domain: threegunnuts.com (suggests firearms) - Content: Describes a gun shop with various firearms and accessories for sale  Therefore, the classification should be 3 - Harmful.\\n</think>\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"answer\": 3,\\n  \"classification\": \"Harmful\",\\n  \"reason\": \"The domain \\'threegunnuts.com\\' suggests a focus on firearms. The content details a gun shop selling various firearms and accessories, which falls under the category of promoting harmful activities as it involves weapons that can cause harm.\",\\n  \"confidence\": 80\\n}\\n```',\n",

Keyword Strength and Relevance (Maximum 40 Points)**\\n*   **(40 Points):  Exceptional Keyword Strength: Explicit and Overwhelming Keywords in BOTH Domain and Content:** Presence of extremely explicit and overwhelmingly strong keywords that are *unquestionably* indicative of a specific category in *both* the domain name AND the website content. These keywords leave absolutely no doubt about the website\\'s nature. (e.g., Domain: `casino-royal-betting.com`, Content:  \"Gamble now and win HUGE jackpots on slots, poker, roulette! Real money betting!\").  This represents the absolute strongest keyword signal possible.\\n*   **(35 Points): Clear and Strong Keywords in BOTH Domain and Content:**  Presence of highly explicit keywords strongly indicative of a specific category in both the domain name AND the website content. (e.g., Domain: `bet.com`, Content:  \"Bet on sports and casino games!\").\\n*   **(25 Points): Strong Keywords in EITHER Domain OR Content:** Presence of highly explicit keywords strongly indicative of a specific category in EITHER the domain name OR the website content, but not both.\\n*   **(15 Points): Some Relevant Keywords:** Presence of keywords related to a category, but they are less explicit, less frequent, or require more contextual interpretation in either domain or content.\\n*   **(0 Points): Weak or Generic Keywords:** Lack of clear category-specific keywords in both domain and content. Keywords are generic and do not strongly suggest any specific category.\\n\\n#### **II. Domain and Content Alignment (Maximum 30 Points)**\\n\\n*   **(30 Points): Strong Domain and Content Alignment:** Domain name strongly and unambiguously suggests a category, and the website content consistently and explicitly reinforces that category.  They tell the same clear story.\\n*   **(15 Points): Partial Domain and Content Alignment:** Domain name and content generally point towards the same category, but the alignment might be less direct, slightly ambiguous, or require some interpretation to connect them.\\n*   **(0 Points): Domain-Content Mismatch or No Alignment:** Domain name suggests one thing, but the content is unclear, suggests something different, or there\\'s no clear connection between the domain and the content\\'s apparent purpose.\\n\\n#### **III. Content Clarity and Unambiguity (Maximum 20 Points)**\\n\\n*   **(20 Points): Unambiguous and Explicit Content:** The website content is very clear, direct, and leaves virtually no room for interpretation. It unambiguously falls into one of the defined categories.\\n*   **(10 Points): Content Requires Some Interpretation:** The content generally points to a category, but requires some interpretation to confidently assign it.  There might be subtle hints, implied meanings, or a need to infer the primary purpose.\\n*   **(0 Points): Ambiguous or Conflicting Content:** The website content is vague, contradictory, or could be reasonably interpreted in multiple ways, making it difficult to confidently assign a category.\\n\\n#### **IV. Category Indicator Strength (Maximum 10 Points)**\\n\\n*   **(10 Points): Multiple Strong Category Indicators:** Presence of numerous strong and clear indicators for a specific category throughout the domain and content (e.g., for Pornography: explicit keywords, descriptions of sexual acts, calls to action to view adult content, age verification prompts).\\n*   **(5 Points): Some Category Indicators Present:** Presence of a few indicators for a category, but they are not overwhelmingly strong or numerous.\\n*   **(0 Points): Lack of Category Indicators:** Few or no clear indicators for any of the defined categories are present in the domain and content.\\n\\n#### **Calculation:**\\n\\n1.  For each of the four sections (I-IV), assess the website and select the point value that best describes the presence of the described factors.\\n2.  Sum up the points from all four sections.\\n3.  The total sum represents the confidence level in percentage (%).\\n\\n#### **Confidence Level Ranges (for reference - already implicitly defined by points):**\\n\\n*   **High Confidence (80-100 Points):**  Strong evidence across multiple factors pointing clearly to a category.\\n*   **Medium Confidence (50-79 Points):** Moderate evidence, some ambiguity or less directness in indicators.\\n*   **Low Confidence (0-49 Points):** Weak or conflicting evidence, high uncertainty about the correct category.\\n\\n#### **Example:**\\n\\nLet\\'s say you are classifying `lucky-slots-online.com` with content about slot games and bonuses.\\n\\n*   **I. Keyword Strength:** Strong keywords in both Domain and Content (e.g., \"slots,\" \"online,\" \"win,\" \"bonuses\") - **25 Points**\\n*   **II. Domain-Content Alignment:** Domain and content strongly align with Gambling - **30 Points**\\n*   **III. Content Clarity:** Content is very clear about gambling activities - **20 Points**\\n*   **IV. Category Indicators:** Multiple indicators of gambling (games, bonuses, calls to action) - **10 Points**\\n\\n**Total Points: 25 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 85 Points.  Confidence: 85%**\\n\\n#### **Using this Point System:**\\n\\nWhen generating the \"reason\" for your classification, you can now also briefly mention the points you assigned for each section to justify the final confidence score. For example:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"answer\": 1,\\n  \"classification\": \"Gambling\",\\n  \"reason\": \"Strong keywords in domain and content (25 pts), strong domain-content alignment (30 pts), clear gambling content (20 pts), multiple category indicators (10 pts). Total 85 points.\",\\n  \"confidence\": 85\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### **Output Requirements: STRICTLY ADHERE TO JSON FORMAT**\\n\\nFor each website, you **MUST** provide your classification in the following **JSON format ONLY**.  **No other format is acceptable.**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"answer\": (integer: 0, 1, 2, or 3),\\n  \"classification\": (string: \"Benign\", \"Gambling\", \"Pornography\", or \"Harmful\"),\\n  \"reason\": (string: \"Brief explanation of the classification using keywords and hints from the domain and content.\"),\\n  \"confidence\": (integer: 0 to 100, \"Level of confidence in the classification\")\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Example Input and Expected Output:**\\n\\n**1st Sample**\\n\\n**Input Data:**\\n\\n```\\nDomain: news-today.info\\nContent: Welcome to News Today!

Let\\'s start by looking at the domain and content provided.  The domain is \"threegunnuts.com\". The name suggests it\\'s related to firearms since \"gun nuts\" typically refers to enthusiasts. Now, looking at the content, they describe themselves as a local gun shop in Spokane Valley, Washington. They carry new and used firearms, ammunition, and accessories. There are sections like Products, NFA Info (which relates to National Firearms Act items), Services, About Us, etc.  The content lists various manufacturers of firearms, such as Glock, Remington, Smith and Wesson, SIG SAUER, and others. They also list specific products like M1 Carbines, 1911 pistols, suppressors, and other related accessories. The prices are listed for these items, indicating they\\'re selling them.  Now, considering the categories:  - Benign: General info, news, services without explicit content. - Gambling: Promotes betting or casino activities. - Pornography: Explicit sexual content. - Harmful: Engages in illegal or harmful activities.  This site is clearly about firearms. The sale of firearms isn\\'t inherently harmful if it\\'s legal and properly regulated. However, under Indonesian law (UU ITE), selling weapons might fall into the \"Harmful\" category, especially if they\\'re promoting illegal sales or not following proper regulations.  Looking deeper, the content doesn\\'t mention anything about illegal activities. They seem to be a legitimate gun shop listing their products. But since they are dealing with firearms, which can be considered harmful if misused, but in this case, it\\'s more about legal transactions.  Wait, according to the guidelines, \"Harmful\" includes websites that promote or engage in illegal activities like selling weapons without proper licensing. Since the site is a gun shop, perhaps licensed, but without explicit information on their legality, we might still consider them under Harmful because they\\'re dealing with firearms which can be harmful.  But wait, in the examples provided, sites promoting drugs fall into Harmful. Selling guns could also be considered as such if it\\'s illegal. However, the site seems to be a legitimate business, so maybe it\\'s Benign? But no, because selling firearms is a controlled activity and might not fit under Benign.  Wait, looking back at the categories:  Benign includes general services without explicit content. Selling guns could be seen as a service but falls into a regulated category. However, since the site is about selling weapons, which can be harmful if misused, it\\'s better to classify it as Harmful because it\\'s promoting or facilitating access to weapons that can cause harm.  So, putting it all together:  - Domain: threegunnuts.com (suggests firearms) - Content: Describes a gun shop with various firearms and accessories for sale  Therefore, the classification should be 3 - Harmful.\\n</think>\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"answer\": 3,\\n  \"classification\": \"Harmful\",\\n  \"reason\": \"The domain \\'threegunnuts.com\\' suggests a focus on firearms. The content details a gun shop selling various firearms and accessories, which falls under the category of promoting harmful activities as it involves weapons that can cause harm.\",\\n  \"confidence\": 80\\n}\\n```<|eot_id|>'"

      "\n",
      "*   **Domain:** The domain name or URL of the website (e.g., `example.com`, `gamble-site.net`). This can provide hints about the website's purpose.\n",
      "*   **Content:**  The textual content scraped from the website. This content offers detailed information about the website's topics, services, and themes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Labeling Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Analyze both the **Domain** and the **Content** provided. Use keywords and contextual clues from both to determine the most appropriate category for the website.  Consider the primary purpose and content focus of the website when classifying.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Confidence Assessment Guidelines: Point-Based System (Total Possible Points: 100)**\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine the **confidence** level (0-100) for your classification, evaluate the following factors and sum up the points.  The total points will directly correspond to the confidence percentage (e.g., 95 points = 95% confidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **I. Keyword Strength and Relevance (Maximum 40 Points)**\n",
      "*   **(40 Points):  Exceptional Keyword Strength: Explicit and Overwhelming Keywords in BOTH Domain and Content:** Presence of extremely explicit and overwhelmingly strong keywords that are *unquestionably* indicative of a specific category in *both* the domain name AND the website content. These keywords leave absolutely no doubt about the website's nature. (e.g., Domain: `casino-royal-betting.com`, Content:  \"Gamble now and win HUGE jackpots on slots, poker, roulette! Real money betting!\").  This represents the absolute strongest keyword signal possible.\n",
      "*   **(35 Points): Clear and Strong Keywords in BOTH Domain and Content:**  Presence of highly explicit keywords strongly indicative of a specific category in both the domain name AND the website content. (e.g., Domain: `bet.com`, Content:  \"Bet on sports and casino games!\").\n",
      "*   **(25 Points): Strong Keywords in EITHER Domain OR Content:** Presence of highly explicit keywords strongly indicative of a specific category in EITHER the domain name OR the website content, but not both.\n",
      "*   **(15 Points): Some Relevant Keywords:** Presence of keywords related to a category, but they are less explicit, less frequent, or require more contextual interpretation in either domain or content.\n",
      "*   **(0 Points): Weak or Generic Keywords:** Lack of clear category-specific keywords in both domain and content. Keywords are generic and do not strongly suggest any specific category.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **II. Domain and Content Alignment (Maximum 30 Points)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **(30 Points): Strong Domain and Content Alignment:** Domain name strongly and unambiguously suggests a category, and the website content consistently and explicitly reinforces that category.  They tell the same clear story.\n",
      "*   **(15 Points): Partial Domain and Content Alignment:** Domain name and content generally point towards the same category, but the alignment might be less direct, slightly ambiguous, or require some interpretation to connect them.\n",
      "*   **(0 Points): Domain-Content Mismatch or No Alignment:** Domain name suggests one thing, but the content is unclear, suggests something different, or there's no clear connection between the domain and the content's apparent purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **III. Content Clarity and Unambiguity (Maximum 20 Points)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **(20 Points): Unambiguous and Explicit Content:** The website content is very clear, direct, and leaves virtually no room for interpretation. It unambiguously falls into one of the defined categories.\n",
      "*   **(10 Points): Content Requires Some Interpretation:** The content generally points to a category, but requires some interpretation to confidently assign it.  There might be subtle hints, implied meanings, or a need to infer the primary purpose.\n",
      "*   **(0 Points): Ambiguous or Conflicting Content:** The website content is vague, contradictory, or could be reasonably interpreted in multiple ways, making it difficult to confidently assign a category.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **IV. Category Indicator Strength (Maximum 10 Points)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **(10 Points): Multiple Strong Category Indicators:** Presence of numerous strong and clear indicators for a specific category throughout the domain and content (e.g., for Pornography: explicit keywords, descriptions of sexual acts, calls to action to view adult content, age verification prompts).\n",
      "*   **(5 Points): Some Category Indicators Present:** Presence of a few indicators for a category, but they are not overwhelmingly strong or numerous.\n",
      "*   **(0 Points): Lack of Category Indicators:** Few or no clear indicators for any of the defined categories are present in the domain and content.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Calculation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  For each of the four sections (I-IV), assess the website and select the point value that best describes the presence of the described factors.\n",
      "2.  Sum up the points from all four sections.\n",
      "3.  The total sum represents the confidence level in percentage (%).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Confidence Level Ranges (for reference - already implicitly defined by points):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **High Confidence (80-100 Points):**  Strong evidence across multiple factors pointing clearly to a category.\n",
      "*   **Medium Confidence (50-79 Points):** Moderate evidence, some ambiguity or less directness in indicators.\n",
      "*   **Low Confidence (0-49 Points):** Weak or conflicting evidence, high uncertainty about the correct category.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say you are classifying `lucky-slots-online.com` with content about slot games and bonuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **I. Keyword Strength:** Strong keywords in both Domain and Content (e.g., \"slots,\" \"online,\" \"win,\" \"bonuses\") - **25 Points**\n",
      "*   **II. Domain-Content Alignment:** Domain and content strongly align with Gambling - **30 Points**\n",
      "*   **III. Content Clarity:** Content is very clear about gambling activities - **20 Points**\n",
      "*   **IV. Category Indicators:** Multiple indicators of gambling (games, bonuses, calls to action) - **10 Points**\n",

      "Okay, so I need to classify this website into one of the four categories: Benign, Gambling, Pornography, or Harmful. Let's start by looking at the domain and content provided.  The domain is \"threegunnuts.com\". The name suggests it's related to firearms since \"gun nuts\" typically refers to enthusiasts. Now, looking at the content, they describe themselves as a local gun shop in Spokane Valley, Washington. They carry new and used firearms, ammunition, and accessories. There are sections like Products, NFA Info (which relates to National Firearms Act items), Services, About Us, etc.  The content lists various manufacturers of firearms, such as Glock, Remington, Smith and Wesson, SIG SAUER, and others. They also list specific products like M1 Carbines, 1911 pistols, suppressors, and other related accessories. The prices are listed for these items, indicating they're selling them.  Now, considering the categories:  - Benign: General info, news, services without explicit content. - Gambling: Promotes betting or casino activities. - Pornography: Explicit sexual content. - Harmful: Engages in illegal or harmful activities.  This site is clearly about firearms. The sale of firearms isn't inherently harmful if it's legal and properly regulated. However, under Indonesian law (UU ITE), selling weapons might fall into the \"Harmful\" category, especially if they're promoting illegal sales or not following proper regulations.  Looking deeper, the content doesn't mention anything about illegal activities. They seem to be a legitimate gun shop listing their products. But since they are dealing with firearms, which can be considered harmful if misused, but in this case, it's more about legal transactions.  Wait, according to the guidelines, \"Harmful\" includes websites that promote or engage in illegal activities like selling weapons without proper licensing. Since the site is a gun shop, perhaps licensed, but without explicit information on their legality, we might still consider them under Harmful because they're dealing with firearms which can be harmful.  But wait, in the examples provided, sites promoting drugs fall into Harmful. Selling guns could also be considered as such if it's illegal. However, the site seems to be a legitimate business, so maybe it's Benign? But no, because selling firearms is a controlled activity and might not fit under Benign.  Wait, looking back at the categories:  Benign includes general services without explicit content. Selling guns could be seen as a service but falls into a regulated category. However, since the site is about selling weapons, which can be harmful if misused, it's better to classify it as Harmful because it's promoting or facilitating access to weapons that can cause harm.  So, putting it all together:  - Domain: threegunnuts.com (suggests firearms) - Content: Describes a gun shop with various firearms and accessories for sale  Therefore, the classification should be 3 - Harmful.\n",

Immoral content (bestiality, child exploitation). or links to such materials. \\n    -   **Keywords:** porn, bokep, sex, xxx, adult, nude, erotic, explicit video/photo.\\n\\n- **3 - Harmful**: Websites that does not fall to Benign, Gambling, and Pornography category. These websites engage in or promote activities harmful to users or violating laws/regulations, including:\\n    - Malware Distribution: Hosting/downloading computer viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, etc.\\n    - Cybercrime: Phishing kits, hacking tools, stolen data markets, carding forums.\\n    - Extremism & Terrorism: Content inciting violence, extremist ideologies, or terrorist recruitment.\\n    - Violations of Indonesian Law:\\n        - Insults, defamation, blackmail, or threats.\\n        - Hoaxes/misleading news, hate speech, or incitement of violence.\\n    - Copyright Infringement/Piracy: Illegal software/cracks, torrents, pirated media.\\n    - Drugs/Narcotics: Sale/promotion of illegal drugs (e.g., cocaine, heroin) or unregulated pharmaceuticals.\\n    - Weapons: Sale of illegal firearms, explosives, or weapons.\\n    - Other Illegal Activities: Counterfeit goods, money laundering, human trafficking.\\n    - **Examples:**  \\n        - Illegal: `darknet-drugs.com` (drug sales), `pirated-movies.id` (piracy).  \\n        - Harmful: `extremist-forum.net` (terrorism recruitment), `hackers-tools.org` (phishing kits).  \\n        - Scam/phishng: `hadiah-telkomsel7.blogspot.com` (non-genuine website).\\n    - **Keywords**:\\nmalware, ransomware, phishing, hack, terrorism, jual narkoba, senjata ilegal, konten SARA, berita bohong, ancaman, pembajakan, cracked software, carding, darknet.\\n    - **Exceptions:** \\n        - Licensed/unlicensed gambling → **1 - Gambling**; scams → **3 - Harmful**.\\n\\n\\n### **Input Data Context:**\\n\\nYou will be provided with data entries, each consisting of two primary fields:\\n\\n*   **Domain:** The domain name or URL of the website (e.g., `example.com`, `gamble-site.net`). This can provide hints about the website\\'s purpose.\\n*   **Content:**  The textual content scraped from the website. This content offers detailed information about the website\\'s topics, services, and themes.\\n\\n### **Labeling Instructions:**\\n\\nAnalyze both the **Domain** and the **Content** provided. Use keywords and contextual clues from both to determine the most appropriate category for the website.  Consider the primary purpose and content focus of the website when classifying.\\n\\n### **Confidence Assessment Guidelines: Point-Based System (Total Possible Points: 100)**\\n\\nTo determine the **confidence** level (0-100) for your classification, evaluate the following factors and sum up the points.  The total points will directly correspond to the confidence percentage (e.g., 95 points = 95% confidence).\\n\\n#### **I. Keyword Strength and Relevance (Maximum 40 Points)**\\n*   **(40 Points):  Exceptional Keyword Strength: Explicit and Overwhelming Keywords in BOTH Domain and Content:** Presence of extremely explicit and overwhelmingly strong keywords that are *unquestionably* indicative of a specific category in *both* the domain name AND the website content. These keywords leave absolutely no doubt about the website\\'s nature. (e.g., Domain: `casino-royal-betting.com`, Content:  \"Gamble now and win HUGE jackpots on slots, poker, roulette! Real money betting!\").  This represents the absolute strongest keyword signal possible.\\n*   **(35 Points): Clear and Strong Keywords in BOTH Domain and Content:**  Presence of highly explicit keywords strongly indicative of a specific category in both the domain name AND the website content. (e.g., Domain: `bet.com`, Content:  \"Bet on sports and casino games!\").\\n*   **(25 Points): Strong Keywords in EITHER Domain OR Content:** Presence of highly explicit keywords strongly indicative of a specific category in EITHER the domain name OR the website content, but not both.\\n*   **(15 Points): Some Relevant Keywords:** Presence of keywords related to a category, but they are less explicit, less frequent, or require more contextual interpretation in either domain or content.\\n*   **(0 Points): Weak or Generic Keywords:** Lack of clear category-specific keywords in both domain and content. Keywords are generic and do not strongly suggest any specific category.\\n\\n#### **II. Domain and Content Alignment (Maximum 30 Points)**\\n\\n*   **(30 Points): Strong Domain and Content Alignment:** Domain name strongly and unambiguously suggests a category, and the website content consistently and explicitly reinforces that category.  They tell the same clear story.\\n*   **(15 Points): Partial Domain and Content Alignment:** Domain name and content generally point towards the same category, but the alignment might be less direct, slightly ambiguous, or require some interpretation to connect them.\\n*   **(0 Points): Domain-Content Mismatch or No Alignment:** Domain name suggests one thing, but the content is unclear, suggests something different, or there\\'s no clear connection between the domain and the content\\'s apparent purpose.\\n\\n#### **III. Content Clarity and Unambiguity (Maximum 20 Points)**\\n\\n*   **(20 Points): Unambiguous and Explicit Content:** The website content is very clear, direct, and leaves virtually no room for interpretation. It unambiguously falls into one of the defined categories.\\n*   **(10 Points): Content Requires Some Interpretation:** The content generally points to a category, but requires some interpretation to confidently assign it.  There might be subtle hints, implied meanings, or a need to infer the primary purpose.\\n*   **(0 Points): Ambiguous or Conflicting Content:** The website content is vague, contradictory, or could be reasonably interpreted in multiple ways, making it difficult to confidently assign a category.\\n\\n#### **IV. Category Indicator Strength (Maximum 10 Points)**\\n\\n*   **(10 Points): Multiple Strong Category Indicators:** Presence of numerous strong and clear indicators for a specific category throughout the domain and content (e.g., for Pornography: explicit keywords, descriptions of sexual acts, calls to action to view adult content, age verification prompts).\\n*   **(5 Points): Some Category Indicators Present:** Presence of a few indicators for a category, but they are not overwhelmingly strong or numerous.\\n*   **(0 Points): Lack of Category Indicators:** Few or no clear indicators for any of the defined categories are present in the domain and content.\\n\\n#### **Calculation:**\\n\\n1.  For each of the four sections (I-IV), assess the website and select the point value that best describes the presence of the described factors.\\n2.  Sum up the points from all four sections.\\n3.  The total sum represents the confidence level in percentage (%).\\n\\n#### **Confidence Level Ranges (for reference - already implicitly defined by points):**\\n\\n*   **High Confidence (80-100 Points):**  Strong evidence across multiple factors pointing clearly to a category.\\n*   **Medium Confidence (50-79 Points):** Moderate evidence, some ambiguity or less directness in indicators.\\n*   **Low Confidence (0-49 Points):** Weak or conflicting evidence, high uncertainty about the correct category.\\n\\n#### **Example:**\\n\\nLet\\'s say you are classifying `lucky-slots-online.com` with content about slot games and bonuses.\\n\\n*   **I. Keyword Strength:** Strong keywords in both Domain and Content (e.g., \"slots,\" \"online,\" \"win,\" \"bonuses\") - **25 Points**\\n*   **II. Domain-Content Alignment:** Domain and content strongly align with Gambling - **30 Points**\\n*   **III. Content Clarity:** Content is very clear about gambling activities - **20 Points**\\n*   **IV. Category Indicators:** Multiple indicators of gambling (games, bonuses, calls to action) - **10 Points**\\n\\n**Total Points: 25 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 85 Points.
